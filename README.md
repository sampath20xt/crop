Agriculture is one of the most important occupation practiced in our country. It is the broadest economic sector and plays an important role in overall development of the country. About 60 % of the land in the country is used for agriculture in order to suffice the needs of 1.2 billion people. Thus, modernization of agriculture is very important and thus will lead the farmers of our country towards profit. Data analytic (DA) is the process of examining data sets in order to draw conclusions about the information they contain, increasingly with the aid of specialized systems and software. Earlier yield prediction was performed by considering the farmer's experience on a particular field and crop. However, as the conditions change day by day very rapidly, farmers are forced to cultivate more and more crops. Being this as the current situation, many of them donâ€™t have enough knowledge about the new crops and are not completely aware of the benefits they get while farming them. Also, the farm productivity can be increased by understanding and forecasting crop performance in a variety of environmental conditions. Thus, the proposed system takes the data regarding the quality of soil and the weather related information as an input.The quality of the soil such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium and Ph value. Weather related information like Rainfall,Temperature and Humidity. In my project we are taking the datasets from Kaggle website.
